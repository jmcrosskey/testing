Connected from Chrome Dev Editor 

My first repository was initialised from the Chrome Dev Editor on a chrome book.  You can't install the 
Git Desktop on a Chromebook but the Dev Editor allows you to synch to your Git Account so I have set this
up for training purposes and it was incredibly easy  

Goals : 
  asynchonous callback functions, 
  use of chrome.document.scan() function, 
  chrome extensions with browser or page action,
  some jquery to scrape data from web page reports,
  content scripting to enable client side modification 
  and facilitation of civiCRM \ user interface.
